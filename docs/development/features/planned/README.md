# Planned Features

Features planned for future development.

## Upcoming Features

*No planned features yet - project initialisation in progress.*

## Workflow

1. Create feature document here when feature is scoped
2. Prioritise features in roadmap discussions
3. Move to `active/` when development begins

## What Belongs Here

- Scoped but not started features
- Features awaiting prioritisation
- Features pending design decisions

## What Doesn't Belong Here

- Active features → [active/](../active/)
- Completed features → [completed/](../completed/)
- Vague ideas → Issues/discussions first
