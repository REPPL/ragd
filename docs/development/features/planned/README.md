## v0.6+ Features

See [Feature Roadmap](../README.md) for full list of future features.

## Workflow

1. Create feature document here when feature is scoped
2. Prioritise features in roadmap discussions
3. Move to `active/` when development begins
4. Move to `completed/` when shipped

## What Belongs Here

- Scoped but not started features
- Features awaiting prioritisation
- Features pending design decisions

## What Doesn't Belong Here

- Active features -> [active/](../active/)
- Completed features -> [completed/](../completed/)
- Vague ideas -> Issues/discussions first
