# Milestone Retrospectives

AI transparency documentation for each milestone release.

## Purpose

These retrospectives document the AI-assisted development process, including:
- What happened vs what was planned
- Manual interventions required
- Documentation drift discovered
- Lessons learned
- Process improvements made

## Structure

Each milestone gets a retrospective file:

| File | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| [v0.1.0-retrospective.md](./v0.1.0-retrospective.md) | Core RAG Pipeline |

## PII Requirements

**CRITICAL**: All retrospectives must be free of personal information:

- No file paths containing usernames (`/Users/...`, `/home/...`)
- No personal email addresses
- No real names
- Use relative paths only

## Template

See `implement-autonomously` agent for the retrospective template.
