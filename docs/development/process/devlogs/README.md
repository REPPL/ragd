# Development Logs

Development narrative and session logs - both human and AI-generated.

## Purpose

Devlogs capture the story of development - challenges faced, decisions made, and lessons learned. They're written in narrative form for future reference.

This directory contains:
- **Human devlogs**: Daily session summaries written by developers
- **AI thinking logs**: Reasoning documentation from autonomous AI agents

AI-generated logs are identified by the `🤖 Generated by Claude` signature at the bottom.

## Available Logs
