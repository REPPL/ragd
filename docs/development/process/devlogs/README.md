# Development Logs

Development narrative and session logs - both human and AI-generated.

**Status:** MANDATORY for all major/minor releases

## Purpose

Devlogs capture the story of development - challenges faced, decisions made, and lessons learned. They're written in narrative form for future reference.

This directory contains:
- **Human devlogs**: Daily session summaries written by developers
- **AI thinking logs**: Reasoning documentation from autonomous AI agents

AI-generated logs are identified by the `🤖 Generated by Claude` signature at the bottom.

## Requirements

Every major/minor release (v0.X.0) MUST have at least one devlog entry capturing:
- Key development decisions
- Challenges encountered
- Lessons learned

Patch releases (v0.X.Y) do not require devlogs unless significant work was involved.
