# Devlog: v0.8.0 Foundation Release

**Date:** 2025-12-03
**Version:** 0.8.0
**Theme:** Intelligence & Organisation - Foundation

## The Story

Today marks the beginning of the v0.8.x series, themed "Intelligence & Organisation". This release establishes the foundation for intelligent document classification and organisation.

## What We Built

### Tag Provenance (F-064)

The humble tag just got a lot smarter. Previously, tags were simple strings - you could add "important" to a document, but you couldn't tell whether you added it manually or if it came from an auto-tagging system.

Now every tag carries its lineage:

```python
TagEntry(
    name="machine-learning",
    source="auto-keybert",
    confidence=0.89,
    created_at=datetime.now(),
    created_by="keybert-v1"
)
```

This sets up v0.8.1's auto-tagging features nicely. When KeyBERT or an LLM suggests tags during indexing, you'll know exactly where they came from and how confident the system was.

### Data Sensitivity Tiers (F-018)

Not all documents are created equal. Your public bookmarks don't need the same protection as your medical records.

We now have four sensitivity tiers:
- **PUBLIC** - Always accessible (green)
- **PERSONAL** - Default tier, basic auth (blue)
- **SENSITIVE** - Requires active session (yellow)
- **CRITICAL** - Session + confirmation (red)

The CLI is intuitive:

```bash
ragd tier set medical-records.pdf sensitive
ragd tier summary  # See distribution across all tiers
```

## Technical Decisions

**Schema Evolution**: We went from v2.1 to v2.2. The migration converts existing string tags to TagEntry objects with `source="legacy"`. This means:
- All your existing tags keep working
- New tags get proper provenance tracking
- You can always tell migrated tags from new ones

**Tier Storage**: Tiers are stored in the existing metadata schema (`ragd_data_tier` field) rather than a separate table. This keeps queries simple and avoids joins.

## Looking Ahead

v0.8.0 is just the foundation. Coming up:
- **v0.8.1**: Auto-tag suggestions, tag library, smart collections
- **v0.8.2**: Reranking and query decomposition
- **v0.8.5**: Knowledge graph and dual-index architecture

The groundwork is laid. Time to build intelligence on top.
