# Milestone: v0.8.5 - Knowledge Graph Foundation

Entity extraction and relationship storage for enhanced document understanding.

## Theme

**"Knowledge Graph Foundation"** - Connect the dots between your documents.

## Features Delivered

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| [F-022](../features/completed/F-022-knowledge-graph.md) | Knowledge Graph Integration | ✅ Complete |

## Use Cases Addressed

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Entity discovery | Automatically identify people, organisations, concepts |
| Relationship mapping | Track connections between entities |
| Knowledge exploration | Discover non-obvious relationships |

## Implementation Notes

### Pragmatic Decisions

1. **SQLite over Kuzu**: Knowledge graph uses SQLite storage instead of Kuzu. Simpler, no new dependencies, sufficient for local use.

2. **Pattern over ML extraction**: Entity extraction uses regex patterns by default. spaCy is optional for higher quality.

3. **Foundation release**: CLI commands for graph exploration deferred to v1.1.

## Technical Approach

### Storage

SQLite-backed graph storage:
- Entities table (id, name, type, metadata)
- Relationships table (source_id, target_id, type, weight)
- Co-occurrence tracking for relationship strength

### Entity Extraction

Two modes:
- **Pattern-based** (default): Fast regex patterns for common entity types
- **spaCy** (optional): Higher quality NER with `en_core_web_sm`

## Test Coverage

- 34 new tests added
- Total passing: 1235

## Dependencies

- v0.8.2 (Retrieval Enhancements)

## Deferred to v1.1

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| Graph CLI commands | Foundation-only release |
| Graph visualisation | Requires WebUI |
| Advanced relationship extraction | Lower priority |
