# Milestone: v0.5.0 - Chat

Conversational interface with local LLM integration.

## Goal

Transform ragd from a retrieval tool into a conversational knowledge assistant. Using local LLMs via Ollama, users can have natural conversations about their documents with full context preservation and quality evaluation.

## Theme

**"Ask and Learn"** - From retrieval to conversation.

## Use Cases Addressed

| Use Case | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Q&A | Ask questions, get answers from your docs | 📋 Planned |
| Summarisation | Summarise documents or topics | 📋 Planned |
| Comparison | Compare information across documents | 📋 Planned |
| Follow-up | Refine queries through conversation | 📋 Planned |

## Features Included

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| [F-013](../features/completed/F-013-ragas-evaluation.md) | RAGAS Evaluation | ✅ Complete |
| [F-014](../features/completed/F-014-agentic-rag.md) | Agentic RAG (CRAG, Self-RAG) | ✅ Complete |
| [F-020](../features/completed/F-020-ollama-llm-integration.md) | Local LLM for generation | ✅ Complete |
| [F-055](../features/completed/F-055-multi-model-orchestration.md) | Multi-Model Orchestration | ✅ Complete |
| Chat History | Conversation context preservation | ✅ Complete |
| Streaming | Stream responses for better UX | ✅ Complete |

## Dependencies

- **v0.4.0** - Multi-Modal must be complete
- **Ollama** - Required for LLM generation

## Technology Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| LLM Backend | Ollama |
| Generation Models | Llama 3.2, Qwen 2.5, Mistral |
| Evaluation | RAGAS / DeepEval with local alternatives |
| Chat History | SQLite or ChromaDB metadata |
| Streaming | Typer streaming output |

## Success Criteria

- [x] Natural conversation with knowledge base
- [x] Answers cite sources from documents
- [x] Conversation context preserved across turns
- [x] Response quality measurable via RAGAS
- [x] Agentic RAG improves response quality
- [x] Streaming responses for better UX
- [x] Works fully offline with local models

## Non-Goals for v0.5

- Multi-user support → Future
- Web UI → v1.0
- Cloud LLM integration → Never (privacy-first)
