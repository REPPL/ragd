# Milestone: v0.8.2 - Retrieval Enhancements

Improved search quality with cross-encoder reranking and query decomposition.

## Theme

**"Retrieval Enhancements"** - More accurate, more relevant results.

## Features Delivered

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| [F-080](../features/completed/F-080-cross-encoder-reranking.md) | Cross-Encoder Reranking | ✅ Complete |
| [F-081](../features/completed/F-081-query-decomposition.md) | Query Decomposition | ✅ Complete |

## Use Cases Addressed

| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Complex queries | Decompose multi-part questions into sub-queries |
| Precision improvement | Rerank results for better relevance |
| Multi-hop reasoning | Answer questions requiring multiple document references |

## Technical Approach

### Cross-Encoder Reranking

Two-stage retrieval:
1. Fast bi-encoder retrieval (existing)
2. Cross-encoder reranking for top-k results

Benefits:
- Higher precision without sacrificing recall
- Better handling of nuanced queries
- Configurable precision/performance trade-off

### Query Decomposition

Complex queries automatically split into sub-queries:
- "How does auth work and what are the security implications?"
- → "How does auth work?" + "What are the security implications?"

Benefits:
- Better coverage of multi-faceted questions
- Improved context for LLM responses

## Test Coverage

- 44 new tests added
- Total passing: 1201

## Dependencies
