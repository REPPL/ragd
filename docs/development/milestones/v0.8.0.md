# Milestone: v0.8.0 - Storage Strategy + Intelligence

Storage architecture decisions and advanced reasoning capabilities.

## Goal

Resolve storage strategy questions (dual-index vs migration) and add intelligent features that understand context beyond simple retrieval. Knowledge graphs reveal relationships between concepts, temporal queries understand time-based information.

## Theme

**"Know You, Know More"** - Intelligence that adapts.

## Use Cases Addressed

| Use Case | Description | Status |
|----------|-------------|--------|
| Backend Optimisation | Query-aware backend selection | 📋 Planned |
| Concept Relationships | Understand how topics connect | 📋 Planned |
| Temporal Queries | "What did I learn last month?" | 📋 Planned |
| Learning Paths | Suggest related knowledge | 📋 Planned |

## Features Included

### Storage Strategy (Requires ADR)

Decision required: Dual-index architecture vs migration-based approach.

| Feature | Description | Status | Notes |
|---------|-------------|--------|-------|
| Dual-Index Architecture | Index both ChromaDB + FAISS | 📋 Needs ADR | Query-aware backend selection |
| Smart Backend Router | Dynamic backend selection | 📋 Needs ADR | Based on query characteristics |
| [F-075](../features/planned/F-075-backend-migration-tool.md) | Backend Migration Tool | 📋 Planned | Alternative if dual-index not chosen |

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Create ADR for dual-index vs migration decision
- [ ] Create feature spec for chosen storage strategy
- [ ] Update this milestone with final scope

### Intelligence Features

| Feature | Description | Status |
|---------|-------------|--------|
| [F-022](../features/planned/F-022-knowledge-graph.md) | Knowledge Graph (Kuzu) | 📋 Planned |
| Persona System | Adapt responses to context | 📋 Planned |
| Temporal Reasoning | Time-aware queries | 📋 Planned |
| Concept Extraction | Build knowledge graph from content | 📋 Planned |
| Related Suggestions | "You might also want to know..." | 📋 Planned |

## Dependencies

- **v0.7.5** - Privacy polish + tagging must be complete

## Technology Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|------------|
| Knowledge Graph | Kuzu (embedded graph DB) |
| Entity Extraction | spaCy NER / local LLM |
| Temporal Parsing | dateparser, relativedelta |
| Persona Management | Configuration + prompt engineering |

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Knowledge graph built from documents automatically
- [ ] Personas configurable (researcher, casual, expert)
- [ ] Temporal queries work ("notes from this week")
- [ ] Related concepts suggested
- [ ] Graph queries enhance retrieval quality
- [ ] Fully offline operation maintained

## Non-Goals for v0.8

- User behaviour learning → Privacy concern
- External knowledge bases → Privacy
- Web UI → v1.0

## Draft Release Notes

### ragd v0.8.0 - Intelligence

**Know you, know more.**

ragd learns from your knowledge, not just stores it.

**New Features:**

- **Knowledge Graph** - Understand relationships between concepts
- **Personas** - Adapt responses to your context
- **Temporal Queries** - "What did I read about auth last week?"
- **Concept Discovery** - Explore related topics
- **Smart Suggestions** - "You might also want to know..."

**Getting Started:**

```bash
# Build knowledge graph
ragd graph build

# Explore concept relationships
ragd graph explore "authentication"

# Set persona for responses
ragd config set chat.persona researcher

# Temporal queries
ragd search "notes from last month about security"
ragd search "what did I learn about APIs this year"
```

**What's Next:**

v1.0 - The personal knowledge platform with web interface and polish.
