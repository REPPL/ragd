## Focus Areas

### Agent Framework (F-400)
```python
# Core agent loop
while not task.complete:
    observation = perceive(environment)
    thought = reason(observation, memory, goal)
    action = plan_action(thought)
    result = execute(action, tools)
    memory.update(result)
```

### Tool Use System (F-401)
Available tools:
- File operations (read, write, search)
- Web search and fetch
- API calls (with authentication)
- Shell commands (sandboxed)
- Database queries

### MCP Integration (F-404)
Model Context Protocol for:
- Dynamic tool discovery
- Standardised tool interface
- External tool servers
- Community tool sharing

### Safety Guardrails (F-407)
- Sandboxed execution environment
- Approval workflows for sensitive actions
- Resource limits (time, memory, network)
- Action logging and audit trail
- Rollback capabilities

## Use Cases

```bash
# Research and summarise
ragd agent "Research quantum computing advancements in 2024 and write a summary"

# Organise documents
ragd agent "Organise my Downloads folder by project"

# Monitor and alert
ragd agent "Monitor news.ycombinator.com for AI articles and notify me daily"

# Answer with web search
ragd agent "What's the latest version of Python and what's new?"
```

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Agents can complete multi-step tasks
- [ ] Tool use is safe and sandboxed
- [ ] MCP tools discoverable
- [ ] Safety guardrails prevent harmful actions
- [ ] Agent memory persists across sessions

## Dependencies
