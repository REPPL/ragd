## Focus Areas

### Long-Term Memory (F-040)

Three memory types:
- **Semantic**: Facts and knowledge
- **Episodic**: Past conversations and events
- **Procedural**: How to do things

```bash
# View memories
ragd memory show
# Semantic: 1,234 facts
# Episodic: 456 conversations
# Procedural: 78 workflows

# Add manual memory
ragd memory add "User prefers concise answers"

# Memory-enhanced search
ragd search "my project" --use-memory
```

### User Profiles (F-041)
- Explicit preferences (set by user)
- Behavioural patterns (learned)
- Topic interests
- Response style preferences

### Personal Vault (F-044)
Separate encrypted store for sensitive data:
- Separate encryption key from main database
- All access logged
- Explicit unlock required
- Auto-lock after timeout

```bash
ragd vault unlock
# Enter vault passphrase: ****
# Vault unlocked for 15 minutes

ragd vault add sensitive-doc.pdf
ragd vault search "medical records"

ragd vault lock
# Vault locked
```
