   - HuggingFace model fetcher for embeddings
   - Heuristic-based model recommendations
   - Model cards with detailed specifications
   - Automatic model suitability analysis

   - Improved agentic chat capabilities
   - Better context management
   - Refined prompt templates
   - Context window auto-detection from model cards

3. **CLI Bug Fixes**
   - Fixed duplicate `-f` flag in `ragd reindex` (changed to `--force` / `-F`)
   - Fixed duplicate `-f` flag in `ragd evaluate` (changed to `--test-file` / `-t`)

## Technical Changes

### New Modules

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `src/ragd/models/discovery.py` | Model discovery and recommendation |
| `src/ragd/models/ollama_fetcher.py` | Ollama model fetching |
| `src/ragd/models/hf_fetcher.py` | HuggingFace model fetching |

### Configuration Changes

- Extended config options for model discovery
- Improved validation for new features

## Test Coverage

- **Total tests:** 1,907 passing
- **Skipped:** 28 (optional dependencies)
- **Warnings:** 17 (3 deprecations to fix in v1.0.1)

## Dependencies

No new runtime dependencies added. All v1.0.0 features use existing packages.

## Breaking Changes

None. v1.0.0 is backwards compatible with v0.9.x configurations.

## Migration Notes

No migration required from v0.9.6. Users can upgrade with:

```bash
pip install --upgrade ragd
```

## Known Issues

1. `datetime.utcnow()` deprecation warnings in test files (to be fixed in v1.0.1)
2. Some bare exception handlers in ingestion pipeline (to be fixed in v1.0.1)
