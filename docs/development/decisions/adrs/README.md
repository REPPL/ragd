# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Lightweight documentation of significant technical decisions.

## Available ADRs

*No ADRs yet - project initialisation in progress.*

## ADR Template

```markdown
# ADR-NNNN: [Title]

## Status

## Naming Convention

| **Accepted** | Decision made, in effect |

## When to Create an ADR

- Choosing a framework or library
- Defining a coding pattern
- Making infrastructure decisions
- Establishing conventions

## What Doesn't Belong Here

- Implementation details → [implementation/](../../implementation/)
- Feature specifications → [features/](../../features/)
- Temporary decisions (use comments instead)
