# Research

State-of-the-art research informing ragd's roadmap and architecture.

## Purpose

This directory contains research on cutting-edge techniques that inform ragd's feature development. These documents survey external literature and industry best practices rather than documenting ragd's internal development.

## Contents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [state-of-the-art-rag.md](./state-of-the-art-rag.md) | Advanced RAG techniques (2024-2025): Agentic RAG, Contextual Retrieval, GraphRAG, etc. |
| [state-of-the-art-privacy.md](./state-of-the-art-privacy.md) | Privacy-preserving architecture: encryption, embedding security, threat models |

## What Belongs Here

- Literature surveys on techniques relevant to ragd
- Research summaries with implementation recommendations
- Comparative analysis of approaches
- References to papers, projects, and industry best practices

## What Doesn't Belong Here

- Internal design decisions → [ADRs](../decisions/adrs/)
- Feature specifications → [Features](../features/)
- Knowledge transfer from ragged → [Lineage](../lineage/)
- User-facing explanations → [Explanation](../../explanation/)
