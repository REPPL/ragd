# Explanation

Conceptual documentation for deeper understanding.

## Purpose

Explanation documentation helps users understand concepts, architecture, and design decisions. It answers "why" questions and provides context.

## Available Explanations

### Getting Started

- [What is RAG?](./what-is-rag.md) — Introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation for non-experts
- [Agentic RAG](./agentic-rag.md) — Self-correcting RAG with CRAG and Self-RAG

### Core Concepts

- [Hybrid Search](./hybrid-search.md) — How ragd combines semantic and keyword search using Reciprocal Rank Fusion
- [Chunking Strategies](./chunking-strategies.md) — How documents are split into searchable pieces
- [Contextual Retrieval](./contextual-retrieval.md) — Adding document context to chunks for better search

### Configuration

- [Model Purposes](./model-purposes.md) — Understanding the five model types (chat, summary, classification, embedding, contextual)

### Alternatives

- [RAG Alternatives](./alternatives.md) — Comprehensive guide to alternative RAG projects

## Explanation Guidelines

When writing explanations:
- Focus on understanding, not doing
- Provide context and background
- Discuss alternatives and trade-offs
- Connect concepts to each other
