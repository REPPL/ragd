# Explanation

Conceptual documentation for deeper understanding.

## Purpose

Explanation documentation helps users understand concepts, architecture, and design decisions. It answers "why" questions and provides context.

## Available Explanations

### Configuration

## Explanation Guidelines

When writing explanations:
- Focus on understanding, not doing
- Provide context and background
- Discuss alternatives and trade-offs
- Connect concepts to each other
