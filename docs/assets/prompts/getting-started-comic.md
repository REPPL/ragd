## 4-Panel Prompt (Recommended)

```
Create a comic with the title: Getting Started with ragd - Your Private Document Assistant

Panel 1: A person sits at their desk surrounded by towering stacks of papers, folders, and documents. They look overwhelmed, with a thought bubble showing question marks and scattered keywords like "Where was that report?" and "What did it say about...?" The scene is drawn in a warm, loose sketch style with expressive pencil lines and soft marker shading. Earth tones and muted blues create a cosy but chaotic atmosphere. At the bottom, text reads: "Ever feel lost in your own documents?"

Panel 2: The same person, now looking curious and hopeful, types a simple command into their terminal. The screen shows "ragd index ~/Documents" with a friendly progress bar filling up. Documents appear to flow into the computer like a gentle stream, transforming into glowing organised blocks. A small mascot character (friendly robot or owl) gives a thumbs up. The sketch style remains warm and approachable, with the terminal rendered in a non-intimidating way - rounded corners, soft colours. Text reads: "Just point ragd at your files. It learns everything - privately, on your machine."

Panel 3: The person leans forward excitedly, typing a natural question: "What were the key recommendations from last quarter's review?" The terminal shows ragd processing this with a simple thinking indicator. Around the person, faint sketchy outlines show different documents being searched - PDFs, notes, reports - all connected by dotted lines converging on the answer. The style is dynamic, showing motion and intelligence at work. Text reads: "Ask questions in plain English. ragd finds the answers."

Panel 4: The person sits back with a satisfied smile, reading a clear answer on their screen with highlighted citations pointing to specific source documents. The messy desk from Panel 1 is now tidy in the background. A speech bubble from the person says "It even tells me exactly where it found this!" The friendly mascot appears again, perhaps holding a small citation flag. The overall tone is triumphant and empowering. Text reads: "Get accurate answers with sources. Your knowledge, unlocked."

The overall tone should feel friendly, empowering, and accessible - like a helpful friend showing you a neat trick rather than a technical manual. The hand-drawn sketch aesthetic should make technology feel warm and human. Make the aspect ratio 16:9.

## 3-Panel Prompt (Condensed)

```
Create a comic with the title: Meet ragd - Ask Your Documents Anything

Panel 1: A person drowning in a sea of documents and folders, looking frustrated. Loose sketch style with warm pencil lines and soft marker colours. Papers float around them with labels like "Q3 Report", "Meeting Notes", "Research". A thought bubble shows "I KNOW it's in here somewhere..." Text at bottom: "We've all been there."

Panel 2: Split panel showing transformation. Left side: the person types "ragd index ~/Documents" - documents stream into a glowing organised library. Right side: they type a question "What did the audit recommend?" in natural language. The sketch style is warm and approachable, making the terminal feel friendly rather than intimidating. Text reads: "ragd reads your documents and answers your questions - all on your private machine."

Panel 3: The person, now relaxed and smiling, reads a clear answer with highlighted source citations. The background shows a neat, organised workspace. A small friendly mascot (robot or owl) gives an approving nod. The person's speech bubble says "And it shows me exactly where it found this!" Text at bottom: "Your documents. Your questions. Your answers. Private and powerful."

Warm, loose hand-drawn sketch style throughout. Make it feel like a friendly tutorial, not a technical manual. Aspect ratio 16:9.

## Customisation Notes

### Mascot
The prompt includes an optional mascot (robot or owl) for personality. Remove these references if you prefer a mascot-free approach.

### Terminal Display
Kept minimal and friendly - just the essential commands without intimidating syntax.

### Privacy Emphasis
Woven in subtly ("on your machine", "private") without making it the central focus per user preference for "power & capability" messaging.

### Adjustable Elements

- **Path**: Replace `~/Documents` with a more specific example if desired
- **Question**: Change "What were the key recommendations..." to match your typical use case
- **Mascot**: Adjust type (robot, owl, other) or remove entirely
- **Aspect ratio**: Currently 16:9, adjust for your platform
