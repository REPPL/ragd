description: >
  Lightweight 384-dimension embedding model optimised for speed.
  Good baseline for RAG systems with limited resources.

capabilities:
  - semantic_search
  - clustering
  - classification

hardware:
  min_ram_gb: 1
  recommended_ram_gb: 2
  min_vram_gb: 0.5
  recommended_vram_gb: 1
  quantisation_supported: false
  cpu_inference: true
  mps_inference: true
  cuda_inference: true

strengths:
  - Very fast inference
  - Small memory footprint
  - Good quality/speed ratio
  - Wide compatibility

weaknesses:
  - Lower dimension than larger models
  - Less nuanced semantics

limitations:
  - Complex semantic relationships
  - Domain-specific terminology
  - Cross-lingual queries

use_cases:
  - Fast document search
  - Resource-constrained environments
  - Development and prototyping
  - High-throughput applications
